            <h1>My journey</h1>
            <p>Highschool, 2022, right after COVID-19. 
            <span class="codelang">JavaScript</span> was my first language,
                however, I learned more due to how interesting
                I found coding to be. 
                A-Frame.
                Python.
                SQL.
                Ruby.
                Lua.
                Although my application of these was lacking, 
                it sparked my love for coding.
            </p>

            <p>2023 was the year I fully understood pseudocode.
                I understood a certain pattern recognition throughout
                all of the programming languages I had learned in the
                previous year, making my journey a lot easier.
                Despite this, I understood that I was only at the 
                beginning.
            </p>

            <p>2024. As it is about to end, I have progressed immensely
                in this wonderful endeavor. I picked my butt up and 
                decided to actually use all of the code I learned.
                This website, for example, is a practical application 
                of my knowledge. So, as I am sure you've seen, 
                please indulge yourself in my work. Enjoy.
            </p>

            <h1>My Endeavors and Goals</h1>
            <p>As a young individual, I understand that I 
                need to have a set of endeavors and goals 
                to strive for. Here is a list of my goals:<br>
                <span>
                    <ul>Broaden my view of the world (move somewhere or go to school in a country other than the U.S) <br></ul>
                    <ul>Learn Japanese, Korean, and Russian (I would like to make friends of all backgrounds) <br></ul>
                    <ul>Live diligently and with much agency (I would like to be seen as independent and competent) <br></ul>
                    <ul>Establish lots of connections throughout my workplace/s and the world in general <br></ul>
                    <ul>Do everything at 100% (What is the point of doing anything if I cannot give it my all?) <br></ul>
                    <ul>Do what I love <br></ul>
